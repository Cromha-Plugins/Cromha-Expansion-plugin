# Development Status
It is currently a Beta plugin.

* A medium WIP (work in progress) plugin
* Story is not fully implemented but for most of the part, it is
* Spaceport and planets descriptions are not fully done
* Quarg-Pug Expansion not finished
* Ember Watse/Remnant/Dark Expansion not finished
* Many more civilizations expansions to do
* Outfits and ships descriptions are not fully done.
* The whole 'Empire Rebels' part is not started very yet. (check [wiki](https://github.com/OcelotWalrus/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/wiki/Governments-&-Major-Factions))
* The [wiki](https://github.com/OcelotWalrus/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/wiki/) still in work and most of the Gameplay section is outdated
* The Lumbarian Empire is currently in a very early stage. Help create the storyline [here](https://github.com/OcelotWalrus/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/discussions/117)

# System requirements
Endless Sky has very minimal system requirements, meaning most systems should be able to run the game. But this plugin is kind of heavy.
It is also important that you play using the **latest unstable beta version of Endless Sky**, the main branch of the official [Endless Sky repository](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky).

|| Minimum | Recommended |
|---|----:|----:|
|RAM | 4 MB | 8 GB |
|Graphics | OpenGL 3.0 | OpenGL 3.3 |
|Storage Free | 900 MB | 3 GB |

## Known issues
  * Game sometimes crash when loading resources (don't have enough RAM)
  * Some outfits or ships don't have texture: it's because we're currently revamping them (the textures to be revamped are in [images/_TEMP/](https://github.com/Cromha-Plugins/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/tree/main/images/_TEMP))
