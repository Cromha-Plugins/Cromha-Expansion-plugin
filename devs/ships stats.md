# Ships Stats Formulas

## Formulas

*These are the formulas that endless sky uses for calculating ships stats like acceleration, max speed and turn rate.*

* thrust / mass = acceleration
* thrust / drag = max speed
* turn / mass = turn rate

## Type of ships

*All thrusting stats, acceleration, mass, drag, turn and turn rate rated by type of ships.*

### Thrust

50-300 | Nanobots/Fuel Pods

300-400 | Heavy Freighters/Bulker/Transporters/Utility

500-600 | Light Freighters/Warship(any type) and some Interceptors/Transporters

700-900 | Empire Warships/Destroyers(without any nanobot)

### Acceleration

30-40 | Heavy Freighters/Bulkers(heavy ones)/World-Ships

50-60 | Interceptors/Warships(any) type/Light Freighters/Destroyers(mostly nanobot carriers)/Transporters/Utility

60-80 | Empire Warships/Destroyers/Fuel Pods

80-100 | Modified Ships/Nanobots

### Mass

50-200 | Light Interceptors/Nanobots/Fuel Pods/Transporters

200-350 | Light Freighters/Interceptors/Empire Warships(interceptor type)/Utility/Light Warships

350-450 | Medium Warships/Heavy Warships(some)/Heavy Freighters/Empire Warships(warships/utility type)/Utility/Destroyers(light type/carriers without any nanobot)

450-700 | Destroyers(heavy type)/World-Ships/Heavy Freighters(rare)

### Drag

1-3 | Nanobots/Fuel Pods/Transporters(rare)

3-5 | Light Freighters/Interceptors/Transporters/Light Warships

6-8 | Warships(medium and heavy)/Heavy Freighters/Empire Warships(interceptor type)/Destroyers(carrier type without any nanobot/light type)/Utility

9-11 | Heavy Warships(rare)/Destroyers(heavy type)/Utility(rare)/World-Ships

### Turn

50-150 | Heavy Freighters/Bulker/Utility

150-280 | Transporters/Interceptors/Warships(medium and heavy type)

280-330 | Light Freighters/Light Warships/Transporters(30% of time)/Destroyers(carriers type without any nanobot and light type)/Empire Warships(heavy and utility type)

700-900 | Empire Warships(light type)/Destroyers(heavy type)

### Turn Rate

50-150 | Heavy Freighters/Bulker/Utility

150-280 | Transporters/Interceptors/Warships(medium and heavy type)

280-330 | Light Freighters/Light Warships/Transporters(30% of time)/Destroyers(carriers type without any nanobot and light type)/Empire Warships(heavy and utility type)

700-900 | Empire Warships(light type)/Destroyers(heavy type)
