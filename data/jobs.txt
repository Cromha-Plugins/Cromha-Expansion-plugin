			`	"Oh definitely! I probably shouldn't even be here - I should really be rehearsing... Oh! Waiter, another beer, please!"`
			`	"Got your slide deck ready for tomorrow?"`
			`	"Yeah, but I'm still terrified. I hate public speaking."`
			`	"Don't worry, you know more about your particular area of expertise than they do. You'll be fine once you're on stage! And besides, graduate school is one giant exercise in public speaking. Comfort comes with practice."`
			` `

			` `

			` `
			`	A group seem to be discussing some other colleagues in the field who are, presumably, not present this evening. "Singh and Esterhazy are such arrogant jerks. Their work is okay, I guess, but not enough to justify their wannabe rockstar personalities!"`
			`	"Sure, but they aren't just arrogant jerks, they're charismatic arrogant jerks. Charisma attracts good grad students to their lab, who produce good papers, who they put their name on. It's a positive feedback loop."`
			` `
			`	Grant applications seem to be a common subject. "The Republic Medical Research Agency said my work is too theoretical, but the University of Chiron Department of Microbiology says it's too applied!"`

			`	A sociable but exhausted-looking man is sitting back in his chair. "These conferences only last three or four days, but it always feels like it ages you a year."`
