	description `Once, when for the first time their Wardragons proved insufficient for dealing with threats, the Quarg decided to improve upon the design of their standard use-case warship. Proving to be a worthwhile successor and step-up from the classic Wardragon, only dire circumstances warrant the deployment of this design.`
	description `	Any forces capable of braving a confrontation with the Quarg should surely reconsider upon seeing any variation in the standard fleet composition of the Quarg.`
