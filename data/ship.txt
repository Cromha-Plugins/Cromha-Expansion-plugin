	description "The fastest and greatest Heavy Warship of all human space. After the great succes of Syndicate's ship 'Manta', to this menace, Cromha Empire decided to create the greatest human ship; a ship that will have human tech and Hai tech together, a big ship that can carry a lot of gun, a lot of cargo, but still enough fast to concurrence other ships. They decided to invade the Syndicated planet Nimbus, to stole the Manta ship plans. Cromha Empire military scientics take the Manta base and remixed it to enhance everything by adding Hai technologies and more outfit and cargo space but also the shields. But the most important thing is the Jump Drive, for yet an unknow technologie for humans. It even has two Ionic Afterburner integrated. Due to the big consummation of fuel of the Jump Drive technologie, this ship have 800Liters of fuel capacity, great for long trips with HyperDrive technologie. This ship can even carry 2 drones and 4 fighters in his bays. The Black Manta is still a prototype but is yet used by The Empire."

	description "The Empire Quicksilver is a warship built around a single concept: to design the smallest and fastest ship capable of carrying two particle cannons. Because of its speed and long weapons range, the Quicksilver can keep a safe distance from most targets and bombard them with particle bursts until they are destroyed. Unfortunately the Headhunter eventually surpassed the original design intent, but the Quicksilver's better durability to cost ratio, and the existence of long-term contracts, has kept it in use with Syndicate security forces."
