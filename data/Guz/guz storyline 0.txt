			`Your blast door opens, and you suddenly see crowd of some sort of bipedal tortoises. They look to all be taller than you. They arms look so big and developed that you can imagine that they can strike you dead in a single blow. They shell seems to cover all their back and their shoulders, which seems to restrain they arms movement. They all seem to be very afraid by you, you can see that these civilization never met humans officially.`

			`A few minutes later, you finally arrive in a room who seems to be a huge office room. They make you sit on a chair in front of their minister. He start to talk:`
			`"Greetings, I don't think you're awarded of us, the Guz'. Let me first introduce me and our species to you. Us, the Guz' are a species that started to developed about 6,000 years ago. We fairly quickly developed spaceflight when we discovered that our star were going to supernova. A hundred years later, met another race and we had a great war. This war laster for about 300 years, leaving at a draw when neither could fight more. We've learned how to make powerful missiles cheaply and it became our primary defense, and we lowly moved onto the offense. By A.D. 1, we were already spreading out and had made contact and wars with a few others aliens. Then, what we call the Great Attack happened, leaving us shrinking. The Great Attack happened around A.D. 100, when be believed we were attacked by many strange enemies. A few of our majors stars went supernova, and many ships of ours disappeared; after a few hundred more years, we were back to a few systems."`

			`"Then, we found The Wormhole and went through it. There we found systems and planets to colonize and exploit, a secret territory. Meanwhile, while we were colonizing, we encountered a weaker race that only had a few systems and no hyperdrives. There was a war between us that lasted 17 years, ending in the destruction of that weaker race. After that, we lived in peace but did not expand much, until the human race began to expand. Then they destroyed some convoys of us, but then abandoned some of their systems on the edge. There was another wormhole that was connected to their space to what would become later the human space. Around A.D. 2,600, the wormhole disappeared. We were now isolated from all other races. During this time of the galaxy, we designed our own shield systems and begin to build larger transport and cargo ships and new warships.`
			`After being isolated from all other races, we split into 3 different species because of a small faction: the Guz'Kah who began to attack other Guz', making them pirates. Because of the Guz'Kah, the two other main factions: the Guz'Pas and the Guz'Huk developed apart but still stayed allies to defend again the Guz'Kah. The Guz'Kah are a pirate-like factions, the Guz'Huk, a faction formed around trading and cargo exportation/importation and the Guz'Pas, a faction formed around warships and artillery development."`

			`"Wow, it is really interesting and complicated. Am I allowing to fly in your systems?" you say.`
			`"You are here, in <origin>, a planet of the Guz'Huk. The Guz'Huk and Guz'Pas have a common 1st minister, me. I'm willing to let you interact with us if you can prove your qualities as a spaceship captain ad as a person of trust."`
			`"Okay, I totally understand, how can I prove that to you?"`
			`"I actually already have a mission for you: if you can to <destination>, eliminate all the Guz'Kah and then land on <planet>, there will be a person waiting for you that will give you a transport that will give you the ability to understand our language, and fly in our systems. You will find the system in the very north of the Wanderer space."`
			`You say goodbye to him and immediately go completing that mission`
