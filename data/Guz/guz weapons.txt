	description `When Dr. Richard J. Gatling invented the rapid-fire gun bearing his name in the 19th century, he hoped that its destructiveness would lead to the end of war itself. Over a millennium later, this modern incarnation of the Gatling Gun sees action in the stars, a testament to its fundamentally robust design - and Dr. Gatling's naivete. While capable of a high fire rate, this gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`
