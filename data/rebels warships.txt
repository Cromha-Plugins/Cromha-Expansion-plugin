	description "After the Blackbird gained surprising popularity as an agile light warship despite its original design as a transport, Tarazed decided to produce a new design specifically intended as a warship. The Osprey was the result. Although it is considered overpriced by most savvy pilots, it is nevertheless a perennial favorite among those who have the extra cash to spend on it."

	description "The Scavenger is an ancient ship: developed hundreds of years ago to transport radioactive materials across human space, it had lost importance with the introduction of generalised and better armed haulers like the Bulk Freighter and the Behemoth. It came back in use as a pirate freighter after the discovery that its radiological shields and internal structure were very efficient at hiding its cargo, interfering with incoming scans enough to block almost all of them."
