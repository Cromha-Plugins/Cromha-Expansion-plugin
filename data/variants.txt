	description "This ship appears to be a hollowed-out asteroid filled with strange equipment. It is unclear what is creating the rays of light, but they must have something to do with how it moves without obvious engines."
	description "	Its advanced properties also allow it to reject the influence of enemy command centers, nullifying their effect."
