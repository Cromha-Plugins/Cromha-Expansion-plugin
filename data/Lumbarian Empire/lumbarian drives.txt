	description "When Imperial Fire Industries first discovered the Jump Drive, they were overjoyed. Here was a new piece of technology to mess with! However, there were a few barriers, such as how it was powered. Many people think it simply burns fuel and zaps you away - but that is not the case. There is a strange source of energy inside the Jump Drive that was nearly impossible to replicate. Yet that precise source was not needed. Some thought to hook it up to the ship's reactor, but it demanded too much energy. Finally a solution was found: solar power. Not solar energy gained from panels, but the true power of a miniature sun inside the drive. It is not perfect, as it generates some heat, but it also grants energy while not in use. Another bonus is that it can overload the drive system to send the user further."
