			`When landing on <origin>, you see the spaceport is in an uproar. There are several screens displaying Emperor Lumbar VI speaking. You cannot hear him over the noise of the crowd. Somebody yells at you, "Down with Lumbar!". Another man punches him in the face, saying, "Emperor Lumbar VI will be far better than Parliament!" You make a hasty departure back to your ship.`
			`	You turn on to the local news to see what is going on. There is a speech from Emperor Lumbar VI saying that the Lumbarian Empire has purchased the Republic, and that Parliament has been disbanded. He now rules all of human space, seemingly.`
