	description "As the Empire Wardragon, this great ship is a remix of the Quarg ship Skylark. Like the Empire Wardragon, this ship is designed for interception, defend and attack missions principally. The only difference with th Empire Wardragon is that the Empire Skylark has been designed for longer missions. With its capability to regenerate fuel easily, it is a great ship for long interceptions missions but also cargo missions since it has a good cargo space."
