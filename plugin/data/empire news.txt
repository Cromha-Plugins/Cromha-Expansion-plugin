			"Can you believe how little they pay for used ships and outfits these days? It's just a scandal!"
			"You know, planets as nice as this one make me want to think about selling off my fleet and retiring."
			"I can't wait to get off this planet. What a dump!"
			"Nice ship, captain. I hope I can afford something like that some day."
			"I keep hearing rumors about ships disappearing north of Syndicate space. It's probably a bunch of hot air, but either way, I'm staying away from there!"
			"I used to be a farmer, dealing with dirt and plants and animals all day. I had dozens of full barns. Thought I had it all. One day, I realized none of it was making me happy. I sold my farm to a retiring merchant and bought their fleet. Best thing I ever did."
			"I'm barely able to turn a profit with the terrible prices at this port."
			"It kind of boggles my mind to imagine that tomorrow I'll be a dozen light-years away. We lead exciting lives, but sometimes I wonder if we don't take enough time to appreciate what's right in front of us."
			"Watch out for pirates! Those lowlifes will snatch every spool of thread out of your hold if you give them the chance. My advice: when you run into them, don't leave anything left to bury."
			"Don't call the Luna shipyard workers Lunatics. They seem to be very sensitive about it."
			"The people from Earth are called Earthlings, but the people from Mars don't want to be called Martians due to those stupid old science fiction stories."
			"Somebody installed my anti-gravity plates upside-down. Luckily I saw it in time! Can you imagine what would have happened if I wouldn't have seen it?"
			"To the optimist the glass is half full, but zero gravity is even better, because there you don't even need the glass."
			"My ship has a built-in cinema, an artificial gravity pool, and an indoor roller-coaster. But you also have a nice ship, I guess."
			"Hey, didn't I see you 3 weeks ago in the 'The Space Bar' on Bourne?"
			"No bread is better than half a loaf, because then the passengers won't fight over it."
			"A painting is worth a thousand words, because the profit margin on transporting visual art is much higher than on dry literature."
			"A journey of a thousand miles has too short of a distance to make any profit."

			"Pirate attacks keep getting more and more frequent, even in star systems that used to be perfectly safe. Why isn't the Navy doing something about it?"
			"I keep hearing rumors about ships disappearing north of Syndicate space. It's probably a bunch of hot air, but either way, I'm staying away from there!"
			"I try to stick to safe parts of space if I can. Pirate attacks are too much risk for my tastes."
			"It's such a shame how much the political situation has deteriorated. We're all humans; why can't we just get along?"
			"I always buy my engines in the Deep. They sell the best of the best up there."
			"With all these pirate attacks, so many people seem to be arming up and outfitting themselves for war, but I think that's a waste of money. Powerful engines, a scram drive, an afterburner, and some anti-missile defenses are all you need to stay safe."
			"Slow and steady wins the race. Hauling cargo may not be very glamorous, but with a big enough fleet, you can net a million a week."
			"Have you ever done any of those jobs moving black cubes around the Deep? I did that a few times but started to get a really weird vibe, and now I stay away if I can. They're hiding something big up there, and I don't want to have any part in it."
			"Have you visited the collapsed wormhole north of Delta Velorum? Well, that's what I think it is, at least. I keep waiting for news that an alien fleet is pouring out of it. I'm sure there must be a way in, too. Haven't found it yet, but I'm not giving up!"
			"A lot of people don't seem to like Syndicate tech, but I don't see what they're complaining about. It's cheap and it gets the job done."
			"My first ship was a Star Barge. Took me seven weeks to get across the galaxy in that old tin can, and my cargo hold smelled of fish the whole time!"
			"My first ship was a Sparrow. How I survived my first week in space, I'm still not sure!"
			"My first ship was a Shuttle. I kind of miss that glorified tour bus."
			"I love doing Syndicate jobs. Easy money for not much work. I guess they're all so rich that they can afford to pay for the best."
			"Why does the Deep restrict the sale of City-Ships? They don't seem that much better than other warships or freighters."
			"I just don't get why anyone would pick the pirate life. Sure, no rules, but any government that doesn't force you to have 10 licenses just to look at a heavy warship is free enough to me."
			"I've heard rumors of captains seeing the distinct flash of whatever Quarg ships use to jump near the core. Wonder what the Quarg are doing up there."
			"Being a pirate must be a lose-lose scenario. You do badly and you end up enslaved to a stronger pirate. You do well and you get enough attention to get targeted by the Navy or Militia."
			"I think that people are too harsh towards pirates. Not all of them are heartless."
			"Be careful when taking suspicious jobs. You might end up at the wrong end of a gun."
			"Always check the spaceport for jobs. Some of them pay quite well."
			"Falcons are the best! They're faster and sleeker than any other civilian warship!"
			"Leviathans are the best! They're tankier and can hold more firepower than any other civilian warship!"
			"Why would anyone use a Falcon? They have specifications worse than the Leviathan in every way, and Falcon hulls cost more to produce."
			"How could anyone use a Leviathan? They're dreadfully slow and an eyesore to look at."
			"Don't be fooled by the Falcon's low retail price! Once you strip out all the outfits, you'll find that the hull costs more than a Leviathan's."
			"People may tell you otherwise, but I think that Vanguards are the best. They have such powerful frontal weaponry."
			"Warships may have both speed and weaponry on their side, but if you're looking for something to last, use a Behemoth."
			"I don't get how people could get worked up over what ship to use. As long as I'm in my trusty Protector, I'm happy."
			"Ugh. Why are fighter pilots so gung-ho about charging right into the guns of their enemies? At the very least, don't make me waste hundreds of thousands of credits replacing my ships when you kill yourself."
			"Don't you think it's strange that the Navy lets you buy their offensive fighters but not any of their other ships?"
			"I wonder why shipyards haven't capitalized on making alternatives to the Navy combat drone. Probably because the only ships that can use drones are Navy ships, I guess."
			"Some of the names that captains give their ships are awful. Seriously, I've seen ships named 'Ship.'"
			"I'm convinced merchant captains make the worst jokes."
			"What's up with the Deep? One moment, they have a defense force on par with the Navy, the next, they're asking random schmucks to help escort their fleets. How the mighty have fallen, I guess."
			"I swear: Sparrows are so laughably weak that Flivvers are a better option for an interceptor."
			"I was doing some jobs in the Core, when an enormous alien warship jumped in and attacked! People say I'm crazy, but I'm lucky to have gotten out of there with my life!"
			"The Syndicate tries to keep alien attacks under wraps, but if you've been around as long as I have, you'll see them eventually."
			"I was working a Syndicate defense job once, expecting to only deal with some pirates. Instead, I had to drive off an alien warship that jumped in same way the Quarg do! They made us sign a non-disclosure agreement, so don't tell anyone I said that."
			"Take caution when doing bounty jobs. After it's accepted, only the bounty hunter is allowed to attack the target. Not even the Navy can help out."
			"I once got hired by someone in search for his true love; he didn't know which ship she left in, so we traveled to dozens of planets to search for her... until he ran out of credits."
			"I once had a passenger that was returning to the spaceport where she met her true love. I still wonder if they ever got together again."
			"I once put 50,000 rifles and 150,000 grenades into my armory. Some of the grenades in the bottom became embedded in the floor because of all the weight on top of them. I still can't get one of them out."
			"I felt lonely, so I participated in Romantic Matchmaking on a Syndicate planet, but that was a big scam! They never asked anything about the type of partner I was looking for, they only asked questions about what I wanted to buy in the next 10 years."
			"I once joined Romantic Matchmaking organized by the Syndicate, but they couldn't tell me anything about my true love due to privacy concerns. Can you believe that?"
			"Romantic Matchmaking as organized by the Syndicate is garbage; they don't even differentiate on gender."
			"I once got married, but my partner didn't allow me to fly further than 5 systems away. Guess what? I'm now more than 5 systems away from my ex-partner."
			"I once married somebody with no credits, and I lost half of my fleet when we divorced."
			"I really found my true love in one of those Romantic Matchmaking programs; my love always joins me on every flight I'm on. We're a great team."
			"I often join those Syndicate Romantic Matchmaking programs; they're a great source to pick up crew members that work for free - at least until they find out. Then I dump them on whatever planet I'm visiting."
			"Truck drivers in the old days were required by law to take a break every 2 hours. Can you imagine that in our business? Stopping our ships every 2 hours to take a rest?"
			"I once had some Flat Earthers as passengers. They claimed that the planets we saw are 2 dimensional circles instead of 3 dimensional spheres."
			"Some Flat Earthers accused me of playing propaganda videos on the ship's viewports when they looked out of the ship while we were in orbit."
			"There's no point crying over spilt milk. But the bill for cleaning the 200 tons of milk that leaked from my ship is no laughing matter either."
			"I spy with my little eye... something large, flat, and sturdy. The landing pads! How did you know?"

			"The corporate farms keep buying out more and more small farmers to expand their own operations. Pretty soon there won't be any of us left."
			"Fancy folks in the big cities and the Paradise Planets think they've got life all figured out, but if you scratch the surface, you'll find that they're slaves to their lifestyles, and we're the ones who are free."
			"I moved here from a richer world and wouldn't ever go back."
			"Surprised to see horses and wooden carts in the 31st century, huh? Sometimes the old ways are the best."

			"It's a good thing the Republic still lets the Syndicate sell pesticides. Without those, I'm not sure how we could grow anything at all what with the tough native weeds on this planet."
			"Did you eat today? Thank a farmer."
			"I used to be a merchant captain like you. Bank account got up to a few million at one point. Thought I had it all. One day I realized none of it was making me happy. I bought this farm and gave the rest away. Best thing I ever did."
			"I came out here because I liked the company of animals more than people like you. Go away."
