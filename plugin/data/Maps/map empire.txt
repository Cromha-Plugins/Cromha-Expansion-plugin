	description `This is a relatively dry planet, and the only Korath cities were close to the poles where the temperatures are more mild and the lifeless deserts give way to grasslands and even a few scattered forests. The largest city was clearly destroyed by orbital bombardment. The other cities seem to have been done in by rioting or looting, leaving smashed windows and burned-out buildings behind. Some of the damage is very recent; the Korath survivors here held out for a long time.`

The ruins of several Korath cities and the geometric grids of cleared land surrounding them show that this was once a farming world, but now few plants are able to survive and kilometer-high glaciers have begun creeping down from the poles. It may be centuries before the skies clear and this world begins to thaw.`
