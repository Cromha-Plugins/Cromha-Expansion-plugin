planet "Phoenix Station"
	attributes deep station
	landscape land/sivael4
	music ambient/machinery
	description `As with all refineries in the Deep, Phoenix Station is government-owned. You cannot imagine who would want to live here; despite reflective hull plating and active cooling systems, the station is uncomfortably hot. Nearly all the work is done by robots and computers, with only a skeleton crew of people supervising. Every time the station's orbit brings it through the planet's shadow, the temperature drops briefly and the entire station creaks ominously as it cools.`

planet Alfheim
	attributes deep factory oil
	landscape land/nasa3
	description `Alfheim is a world of wide grassy plains, deserts, a few small oceans, and scattered rainforests. Not a pleasant enough planet to support large cities, it is instead mostly a site for oil drilling and manufacturing. So far only a tiny fraction of the surface has been developed, mostly clustered around the sites where the largest oil deposits have been discovered.`
	description `	Settlements show up as small bright points on the dark side of the planet - not from city lights, but from natural gas burnoff at the drilling stations.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is in the middle of a field of oil derricks so vast that from above, the desert seemed to be covered in spiky gray fur. The spaceport itself is a soaring canopy, made to look like a tent, or sails on a ship. But it is built of a sturdy composite of plastic and carbon fiber, and coated in reflective plastic. Inside, hovercraft and massive sand-crawlers are bringing cargo to and from the refineries and factories scattered across the planet's surface.`
