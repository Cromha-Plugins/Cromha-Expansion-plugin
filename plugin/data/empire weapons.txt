	description "The Particle Cannon works by accelerating a short burst of particles to near-relativistic speeds. When mounted on a ship that can turn fast enough to keep it trained on approaching ships, it becomes a nearly unbeatable weapon, capable of destroying smaller ships before they can even approach close enough for their comparatively short-ranged weapons to be effective."

	description "The Ion Proton Gun started out as the Empire's attempt to reverse engineer and mass produce a cheap competitor for the Electon Turret. Unfortunately, they were unable to find a reliable way to keep the beam coherent, but the resulting weapon is still used in all heavy empire ships, particularly as an anti-fighter gun."
