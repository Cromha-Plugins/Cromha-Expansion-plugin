	description "Las tah is a world of wide grassy plains, deserts, a few small oceans, and scattered rainforests. Not a pleasant enough planet to support large cities, it is instead mostly a site for oil drilling and manufacturing. So far only a tiny fraction of the surface has been developed, mostly clustered around the sites where the largest oil deposits have been discovered."
	description "Settlements show up as small bright points on the dark side of the planet - not from city lights, but from natural gas burnoff at the drilling stations."
	spaceport "The spaceport is in the middle of a field of oil derricks so vast that from above, the desert seemed to be covered in spiky gray fur. The spaceport itself is a soaring canopy, made to look like a tent, or sails on a ship. But it is built of a sturdy composite of plastic and carbon fiber, and coated in reflective plastic. Inside, hovercraft and massive sand-crawlers are bringing cargo to and from the refineries and factories scattered across the planet's surface."
