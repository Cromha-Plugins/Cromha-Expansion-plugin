	description "The Tarazed Blackbird is a high-class passenger transport, designed to move large numbers of people across the galaxy with speed and safety. Although not equipped with much weaponry, a Blackbird is well protected and fast enough to evade pirate attacks, and its cargo capacity is high enough to allow the captain to take courier missions on the side."

	description "The Argosy from Southbound Shipyards is very popular with merchants not because of its capacity, which is actually slightly smaller than the Syndicate Freighter, but because it can hold its own in combat even against a small pirate fleet."
	description "	The Argosy is also a very easy ship to upgrade with faster engines or more powerful weapons as needed, so many privately owned Argosies have very different capabilities than the stock model."

	description "The Fury is Southbound Shipyards' most popular design of escort ship. They have greater firepower than any other interceptor-class vessel, meaning that any pirate flying solo will think twice before attacking a convoy that is accompanied by a Fury. However, Furies are also much less maneuverable than other small ships."
