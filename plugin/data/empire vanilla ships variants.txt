	description "The Tarazed Blackbird is a high-class passenger transport, designed to move large numbers of people across the galaxy with speed and safety. Although not equipped with much weaponry, a Blackbird is well protected and fast enough to evade pirate attacks, and its cargo capacity is high enough to allow the captain to take courier missions on the side."
