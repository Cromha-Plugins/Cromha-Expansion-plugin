	description "As the Empire Wardragon, this great ship is a remix of the Quarg ship Skylark. Like the Empire Wardragon, this ship is designed for interception, defend and attack missions principally. The only difference with th Empire Wardragon is that the Empire Skylark has been designed for longer missions. With its capability to regenerate fuel easily, it is a great ship for long interceptions missions but also cargo missions since it has a good cargo space."

	description "The goal of the Lifdot Industries was to build a new warship capable of destroying a whole Korath Exiles fleet himself. So the best way was to reuse an Korath Exiles ship model."

Even if it is supposed to be a Warship, the Empire Navy more use it as an Interceptor to capture wanted outalaws or Empire Rebels."
