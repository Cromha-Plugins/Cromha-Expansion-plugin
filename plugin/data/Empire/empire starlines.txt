	description "Originally designed as a luxury habitat for those wealthy enough to escape living on the polluted surface of Korath worlds, when the Korath were exiled, it was into these gargantuan 'world-ships' they first crammed themselves into and fled to the core on. Nostalgically, the class was then renamed after the devastated and now forbidden Korath homeworld."
	description "	Since the introduction of purpose-built city ships, these ancient vessels have mostly been decommissioned, turned into stations, or reconfigured into smaller, specialized vessels. Yet a few still ply the starlanes, crewed by those too restless to live on stations yet not bold enough to go on raids."
