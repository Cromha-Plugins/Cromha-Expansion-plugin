	description "The Empire Palavret is a cheaper and stealthier version of the Empire Tubfalet. This was designed by the Lifdot Industries to have a cheaper price but still be good for outlaws and small Empire Rebels drugs interceptions missions. This ship had a large succes after it was created."
	description "The goal of the Lifdot Industries was to build a new warship capable of destroying a whole Korath Exiles fleet himself. So the best way was to reuse an Korath Exiles ship model."
	description "The second goal was to build a ship with the size of an Empire Galactik but with more compact outfits so it can be more maveuvrable and can carry more cargo if needed. Even if it is supposed to be a Warship, the Empire Navy more use it as an Interceptor to capture wanted outalaws or Empire Rebels."

	description "The Empire Palavret is a cheaper and stealthier version of the Empire Tubfalet. This was designed by the Lifdot Industries to have a cheaper price but still be good for outlaws and small Empire Rebels drugs interceptions missions. This ship had a large succes after it was created."
	description "The goal of the Lifdot Industries was to build a new warship capable of destroying a whole Korath Exiles fleet himself. So the best way was to reuse an Korath Exiles ship model."
	description "The second goal was to build a ship with the size of an Empire Galactik but with more compact outfits so it can be more maveuvrable and can carry more cargo if needed. Even if it is supposed to be a Warship, the Empire Navy more use it as an Interceptor to capture wanted outalaws or Empire Rebels."
